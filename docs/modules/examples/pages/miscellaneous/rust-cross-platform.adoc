= Helloworld in Rust (Cross Platform)

The link:https://github.com/jreleaser/helloworld-rustx[] repository shows the configuration and steps to:

 - Compile a helloworld app for the following targets:
   ** `aarch64-apple-darwin`
   ** `x86_64-apple-darwin`
   ** `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
   ** `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
 - Use `cross` to compile for `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
 - Use `lipo` to generate an universal binary for apple-darwin
 - Assemble zip distributions with JReleaser
 - Create rolling early-access releases with JReleaser on every push to `main` branch
