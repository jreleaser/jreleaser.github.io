= Helloworld in Java (JAVA_BINARY)

The https://github.com/jreleaser/helloworld-java-bin[] repository shows how to configure link:https://github.com/features/actions[GitHub Actions] and link:https://jreleaser.org/[JReleaser] to:

 * compile a helloworld app
 * assemble a zip distributions with JReleaser
 * create rolling early-access releases with JReleaser on every push to `main` branch

There are two modes for packaging this application: classpath & modulepath.

*classpath*

 1. `./mvnw verify`
 2. `jreleaser assemble`

*modulepath*

 1. `./mvnw verify`
 2. `jreleaser assemble --config-file jreleaser-modules.yml`

In both cases the assembled archive is placed at `out/jreleaser/assemble/helloworld/java-archive`.
