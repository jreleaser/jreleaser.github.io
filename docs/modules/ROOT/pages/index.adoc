= JReleaser

JReleaser is a release automation tool for Java projects. Its goal is to simplify creating releases and publishing artifacts
to multiple package managers while providing customizable options.

== What it does

JReleaser takes inputs from popular builds tools (Ant, Maven, Gradle) such as JAR files, binary distributions
(`.zip`, `.tar`), JLink images, or any other file that you'd like to publish as a Git release on popular Git services
such as GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea. Distribution files can additionally be published to be consumed by popular package managers
as Homebrew, Snapcraft, Scoop, or get ready to be launched via Jbang. Releases may be announced in a variety of channels such
as Twitter, Zulip, SdkMan!, and others.

== How does it work

A release process can be customized with a `jreleaser.[yml|toml|json]` file if using the xref:tools:jreleaser-cli.adoc[CLI] or
xref:tools:jreleaser-ant.adoc[Ant] options, or direct DSL configuration inside a `pom.xml` (xref:tools:jreleaser-maven.adoc[Maven]) or
`build.gradle` (xref:tools:jreleaser-gradle.adoc[Gradle]) file.

Once setup, you can create a new release by invoking the `full-release` command.

Every step of the release process is configurable. Inputs may be parameterized externally; several input files may be
provided as templates.

JReleaser is heavily inspired by link:https://goreleaser.com[GoReleaser], it also builds on top of the lessons learned
from link:github.com/jbangdev/jbang[jbang]'s build setup.
