= JReleaser

JReleaser is a release automation tool. Its goal is to simplify creating releases and publishing artifacts
to multiple package managers while providing customizable options. However, you may also use it with projects that do
not require publishing binary assets. The tool can be used to create Git releases (tag, changelog, assets), announce releases,
assemble additional binaries and files to be published via package managers. JReleaser supports any kind of project regardless
of its source language (Java, Go, Node, Rust, Perl, Python, C/C++, C#, Elixir, Haskell, etc), although it provides additional
benefits to Java based projects.

Examples of Java projects:

 * xref:examples:java/java-binary.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:java/jlink.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:java/jpackage.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:java/binary.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:java/single-jar.adoc[]

Examples of non-Java projects:

 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/ballerina.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/bun.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/cpp.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/crystal.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/csharp.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/deno.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/elixir.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/go.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/haskell.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/nim.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/ocaml.adoc[]
 * xref:examples:miscellaneous/odin.adoc[]

== What it does

JReleaser takes inputs from well known build tools (Apache Ant, Apache Maven, Gradle, Cargo, NPM, Cabal, etc) such as JAR
files, binary distributions (`.zip`, `.tar`), JLink images, or any other file that you'd like to publish as a Git release
on popular Git services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea. Distribution files may additionally be published to package
managers such as Homebrew, Snapcraft, Scoop, or get ready to be launched via JBang. Releases may be announced to a variety
of channels such as Twitter, Mastodon, Zulip, Sdkman, and others. Have a look at the listed xref:integrations.adoc[integrations].

JReleaser provides explicit integration via plugins for {icon_ant_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-ant.adoc[Apache Ant],
{icon_maven_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-maven.adoc[Apache Maven], and {icon_gradle_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-gradle.adoc[Gradle] build tools.
Use the {icon_cli_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-cli.adoc[CLI] for any other build tool (Java and non-Java alike).

== How does it work

A release process can be customized with a `jreleaser.[yml|toml|json]` file if using the
{icon_cli_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-cli.adoc[CLI] or {icon_ant_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-ant.adoc[Apache Ant] options, or
direct DSL configuration inside a `pom.xml` ({icon_maven_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-maven.adoc[Apache Maven]) or
`build.gradle` ({icon_gradle_s} xref:tools:jreleaser-gradle.adoc[Gradle]) file.

Once setup, you can create a new release by invoking the `full-release` command or any other commands described in the
xref:concepts:workflow.adoc[].

Every step of the release process is configurable. Inputs may be parameterized externally. Several input files may be
provided as templates.

== Where does it run

You can run JReleaser at your local development machine or at any of the supported
xref:continuous-integration:index.adoc[CI/CD] services.
