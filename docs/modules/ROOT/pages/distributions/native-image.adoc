= Native Image

Distributions of this type provide a platform specific native binary, as a consequence you *must* specify a platform value
for each one of their artifacts.

Distributions of this type conform to the following file structure:

[source]
----
.
├── LICENSE
├── README
└── bin
    └── executable
----

== Creating a Distribution

Native image binaries can be created in many ways. Frameworks such as Micronaut, Quarkus, and Helidon provide Maven and
Gradle plugins that can create such binaries.

.Maven

 * link:https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/NativeImageMavenPlugin/[native-image-maven-plugin]
 * link:http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/[maven-assembly-plugin]: packages the distribution as a Zip.

.Gradle

 * link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/distribution_plugin.html[distribution] plugin: packages a distribution as a Zip.

Alternatively, you may also configure a xref:configuration:assemble/native-image.adoc[] assembler.
