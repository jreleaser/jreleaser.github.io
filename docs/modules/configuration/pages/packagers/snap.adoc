link:http://snapcraft.io[Snaps] are a new packaging format, that will let you publish your project directly to the
Ubuntu store. From there it will be installable in all the link:https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install[supported Linux distros],
with automatic and transactional updates.

You can read more about it in the link:https://snapcraft.io/docs/[snapcraft docs].

NOTE: Only artifacts with `.tar.gz`, `.tar`, or `.jar` extension may be packaged with Snapcraft.

WARNING: Snapshots are *not* supported.

IMPORTANT: Building local snaps requires `snapcraft` to be pre installed. JReleaser will not install it nor its
dependencies.

Template files may be initialized using the `template` command.

NOTE: The snap token environment variable must match with the chosen xref:release/index.adoc[] service, that is, it must
be one of [`JRELEASER_SNAP_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `JRELEASER_SNAP_GITLAB_TOKEN`, `JRELEASER_SNAP_GITEA_TOKEN`].

Assuming that the current version is `1.2.3`, and a distribution named `app`, the above configuration will generate
a `snapcraft.yaml` file which may be published to `app-snap`

== Templates

The default location for templates is:

`src/jreleaser/distributions/<distribution-name>/snap`

The following list shows the filenames that may be used to override default templates:

* `snap/snapcraft.yaml.tpl`
* `.gitignore`
* `README.md.tpl`

Any additional files found in the template directories will be copied as is unless their filename ends with `.tpl` in
which case xref:name-templates.adoc[] substitution will take place.
