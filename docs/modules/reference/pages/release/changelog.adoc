The changelog section is common to all releasers. The reference shows the use of `github` but you may substitute it
with the appropriate releaser of your choice.

WARNING: JReleaser requires a full copy of the codebase. Using a shallow copy may result in partial changelog or errors.
Note the use of `fetch-depth: 0` option on the `Checkout` step when running on GitHub Actions for example.

You may define either `content` or `contentTemplate`, with the latter taking precedence over the former.

Changelog formatting applies only to the automatically generated changelog, that is, formatting won't occur if the `external`
property is set. Please note that the `formatted` property must also be set. Format applies only to local commits at the moment,
the use of labelers is highly encouraged.

The `changelog.format` property accepts only the following name templates:

[%header, cols="<2,<5", width="100%"]
|===
| Key             | Description
| commitShortHash | head commit hash abbreviated to 7 characters
| commitFullHash  | head commit hash
| commitTitle     | first line of the commit message
| commitAuthor    | full name of the commit author
| commitBody      | full commit message
| commitsUrl      | commits URl as provided by the Git host
|===

If the `conventional-commits` preset is configured then the following name templates are also available:

[%header, cols="<2,<5", width="100%"]
|===
| Key                                     | Description
| commitIsConventional                    | a boolean identifying the commit as conventional
| conventionalCommitIsBreakingChange      | a boolean indicating if the commit contains a breaking change
| conventionalCommitBreakingChangeContent | an optional message related to the breaking change
| conventionalCommitType                  | the commit's type i.e, `build`, `feat`, etc
| conventionalCommitScope                 | the commit's optional scope i.e, `core`, `plugins`, etc
| conventionalCommitDescription           | the commit's description
| conventionalCommitBody                  | the commit's full message
| conventionalCommitTrailers              | optional Git trailers such as `Co-authored-by:`, etc.
|===

The `content` and `contentTemplate` accept all xref:reference:name-templates.adoc[], take special consideration on
`{{changelogChanges}}` and `{{changelogContributors}}` as they define the parsed commits.

If you want to omit merge commits in the changelog, use `skipMergeCommits` property. If not set, defaults to `{{false}}`.

== Templates

The default location for templates is:

`src/jreleaser/templates`

The following list shows the filenames that may be used to override default templates:

* `changelog.tpl`

== Commits

If you wish to generate the changelog between two tags, with tags in between, you may configure `previousTagName`.
It generates the changelog based on all commits between the two tags. (`git log <previousTagName>...<tagName>`).

If not defined, it will default to the logical previous tag of the defined `tagName`.

== Contributors

Contributor names are added to the formatted changelog by default. You may choose to provide a custom format or disable
this behavior completely. The `contributors.format` property accepts the following templates:

[%header, cols="<2,<5", width="100%"]
|===
| Key                       | Description
| contributorName           | the contributor's name as plain text
| contributorNameAsLink     | the contributor's name as a link
| contributorUsername       | the contributor's username as plain text
| contributorUsernameAsLink | the contributor's username as a link
|===

The use of `{{contributorNameAsLink}}`, `{{contributorUsername}}`, or `{{contributorUsernameAsLink}}` incurs on a
network call to the remote service to find out information related to the given contributor.

NOTE: Use a `-` or `*` character as prefix in `format` to list each contributor on its own row.

The following configuration

[source,yaml]
[subs="+macros,attributes"]
----
release:
  github:
    username: aalmiray
    overwrite: true
    draft: false
    sign: true
    changelog:

      format: '- {{commitShortHash}} {{commitTitle}}'
      labelers:
        - label: 'feature'
          title: 'Resolves #'
          body: 'Resolves #'
        - label: 'issue'
          title: 'Fixes #'
          body: 'Fixes #'
        - label: 'issue'
          title: 'Relates to #'
          body: 'Relates to #'
        - label: 'task'
          title: '[chore]'
      categories:
        - title: '🚀 Features'
          key: 'features'
          labels:
            - 'feature'
        - title: '✅ Issues'
          key: 'issues'
          labels:
            - 'issue'
        - title: '🧰 Tasks'
          key: 'tasks'
          labels:
            - 'task'
      replacers:
        - search: '\[chore\] '

== Order

Both labelers and categories will be ordered based on their declared location however you may change this order by
explicitly setting a value for their `order` property. The lower the number the higher the priority. The value of the
`order` property must be unique.

== Presets

Presets define conventions applicable to:

 * labelers
 * categories
 * replacers
 * hide
   ** categories
   ** contributors

You may apply a preset while at the same time define additional elements. Your configuration takes precedence over the
preset's, allowing you to add/merge. For the time being you can't remove a setting defined by a preset.

=== Conventional Commits

Commit messages that follow the link:https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[Conventional Commits] specification
will be automatically labeled and categorized. The following table shows mappings that you may use when this preset is
applied:

[%header]
|===
| Category         | Key      | Order  | Label    | Prefix       | Order
| 🔀 Merge         | merge    | 0      | merge    | Merge pull   | 0

You may define an optional scope as part of the prefix, such as `fix(core)` or `feat(plugins)`. A `!` in the prefix will
be replaced with a 🚨 emoji. All prefixes will be removed except for their scope. The following commits

----
feat: Add download urls
fix: Fix typos
fix(core): Add missing checks in loader
fix(engine)!: Plugins require custom classloader

== Appending

JReleaser may append the changelog for a given release to an existing changelog (typically `CHANGELOG.md` at the root of
the project). This can be achieved by enabling the `append` block, for example

[source,yaml]
[subs="+macros,attributes"]
----
release:
  github:
    changelog:
      formatted: always
      categoryTitleFormat: '#### {{categoryTitle}}'

Note the use of a special comment as anchor for finding the right place to append the generated changelog. If the anchor
does not exist then the generated changelog will be prepended at the beginning of the full changelog.

NOTE: Changelog appending is only active when a project is not snapshot.

IMPORTANT: JReleaser does not verify if a previous tag is already found in the full changelog before appending.

== Examples
