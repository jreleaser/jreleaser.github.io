= Distributions

A distribution is a set of artifacts that contain the program/application that consumers will run.
Typically, distributions package executable launcher scripts, required JAR dependencies, sometimes even
a Java runtime. Distributions are often packaged as either Zip or Tar files.

A typical distribution defines the following properties:

* a unique name identifying the distribution.
* the platform they require to run. If not defined it means the distribution runs on all supported platforms.
* a type of distribution. Distribution types enable the use of certain packagers.
