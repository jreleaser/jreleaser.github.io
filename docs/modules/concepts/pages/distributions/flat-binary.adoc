= Flat Binary

Distributions of this type provide a platform specific native binary, as a consequence you *must* specify a platform value
for each one of their artifacts.

Distributions of this type only provide a single executable binary with no additional files. Should you require more than
one file then have a look at the xref:distributions/binary.adoc[] distribution.

== Creating a Distribution

You can use any tool/language at your disposal to create binary executables.

== Packager Support

== Universal Binaries

Binary distributions are expected to deliver platform specific binaries thus every artifact must have a value set for their
respective `platform` property. However, it's possible to skip validating this setting by defining an extra property named
`universal`, like it's shown in the following snippet:

[source,yaml]
----
distributions:
  app:
    type: FLAT_BINARY
    artifacts:
      - path: target/distributions/{{distributionName}}/{{distributionName}}-{{projectVersion}}
        extraProperties:
            universal: true
----
