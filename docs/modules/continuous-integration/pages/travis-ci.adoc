= Travis CI

JReleaser can be run as a deploy script in link:https://travis-ci.com/[Travis-CI].

NOTE: If you're already building with either Maven or Gradle then you might use the
xref:tools:jreleaser-maven.adoc[] or the xref:tools:jreleaser-gradle.adoc[] instead.

[source,yaml]
..travis.yml
----
language: java

jdk: openjdk11

script: ./mvnw -B verify

deploy:
  - provider: script
    skip_cleanup: true
    script:
      # Get the jreleaser downloader
      - curl -sL https://git.io/get-jreleaser > get_jreleaser.java
      # Download JReleaser with version = <version>
      # Change <version> to a tagged JReleaser release
      # or leave it out to pull `latest`.
      - java get_jreleaser.java <version>
      # Let's check we've got the right version
      - java -jar jreleaser-cli.jar --version
      # Execute a JReleaser command such as 'full-release'
      - java -jar jreleaser-cli.jar full-release
    on:
      branch: main
----

If you rather see what JReleaser is doing then set it up as an `after_script:` hook instead:

[source,yaml]
----
language: java

jdk: openjdk11

script: ./mvnw -B verify

after_script:
  # Get the jreleaser downloader
  - curl -sL https://git.io/get-jreleaser > get_jreleaser.java
  # Download JReleaser with version = <version>
  # Change <version> to a tagged JReleaser release
  # or leave it out to pull `latest`.
  - java get_jreleaser.java <version>
  # Let's check we've got the right version
  - java -jar jreleaser-cli.jar --version
  # Execute a JReleaser command such as 'full-release'
  - java -jar jreleaser-cli.jar full-release
----

TIP: You may use `latest` to pull the latest stable release or `early-access` to pull the latest snapshot.

IMPORTANT: The deploy script must run with Java 11 or greater..

NOTE: You must use link:https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/[encrypted environment variables] to
configure environment variables such as `JRELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN` and any other secrets required by the build.
