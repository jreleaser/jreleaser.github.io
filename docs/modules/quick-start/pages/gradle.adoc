= Gradle

Your project should be able to produce binary distributions, a feat typically achieved by configuring
the `link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html[application]` plugin.

You also have to configure the xref:tools:jreleaser-gradle.adoc[jreleaser-gradle-plugin].

A straight forward project configuration could look like this:

[source,groovy]
[subs="+macros,attributes"]
.build.gradle
----
plugins {
    id 'java-library'
    id 'application'
    id 'org.jreleaser' version '{jreleaser-version}'
}

application {
    mainClass = 'com.acme.Main'
}

jreleaser {
    project {
        authors = ['Duke']
        license = 'Apache-2.0'
        links {
            homepage = 'pass:[https://acme.com/app]'
        }
        inceptionYear = '2021'
    }

    release {
        github {
            repoOwner = 'duke'
            overwrite = true
        }
    }
    distributions {
        app {
           artifact {
               path = 'build/distributions/{{distributionName}}-{{projectVersion}}.zip'
           }
        }
    }
}
----

You could also use the link:https://kordamp.org/kordamp-gradle-plugins/[Kordamp plugins] to setup the project as they
provide additional benefits, however their use is optional. A sample project using Kordamp may look like this:

[source,groovy]
[subs="+macros,attributes"]
.build.gradle
----
plugins {
    id 'java-library'
    id 'application'
    id 'org.kordamp.gradle.java-project' version '0.47.0'
    id 'org.jreleaser' version '{jreleaser-version}'
}

application {
    mainClass = 'com.acme.Main'
}

config {
    info {
        name          = 'app'
        description   = 'App'
        inceptionYear = '2021'
        vendor        = 'Acme'

        links {
            website      = 'pass:[https://acme.com/app]'
            issueTracker = 'pass:[https://github.com/duke/app/issues]'
            scm          = 'pass:[https://github.com/duke/app.git]'
        }

        scm {
            url                 = 'pass:[https://github.com/duke/app]'
            connection          = 'scm:git:https://github.com/duke/app.git'
            developerConnection = 'scm:git:git@github.com:duke/app.git'
        }
        
        people {
            person {
                id    = 'duke'
                name  = 'Java Duke'
                roles = ['developer', 'author']
            }
        }
    }

    licensing {
        licenses {
            license {
                id = 'Apache-2.0'
            }
        }
    }
}

jreleaser {
    release {
        github {
            repoOwner = 'duke'
            overwrite = true
        }
    }
    distributions {
        app {
           artifact {
               path = 'build/distributions/{{distributionName}}-{{projectVersion}}.zip'
           }
        }
    }
}
----

This setup configures the project with the following

* Generate additional JAR manifest entries.
* Generate a `-sources` JAR file with all sources per project.
* Configure the javadoc task for each project using information found in the config block, such as author,
  copyright year, default settings.
* Generate a `-javadoc` JAR file with the output of the javadoc task, per project.
* Configure the license plugin with the license details
* Configure the maven-publish plugin. The `-sources` and `-javadoc` JARs are automatically added to the default publication.
* Configure the generated POM.
* Configure the jacoco plugin.
* Generate a source stats task.
* Generate a task to collect pretty-printed sources.

Which ever option you choose to get started, make sure to edit the file to suite your needs. Once you have edited the
file you may verify its configuration by invoking

[source]
----
$ gradle jreleaserConfig
----

At any time you may invoke any of the other commands, but when it's time to make a release you have to invoke

[source]
[subs="+macros,attributes"]

This command performs the following actions:

* checksums all artifacts.
* signs all files (if signing is enabled).
* creates a release at the chosen Git repository.
* prepares, packages, and uploads configured packagers (brew, jbang, etc).
* announces the release (if configured).

TIP: JReleaser generates 2 files after most commands are run. These are `output.properties` and `trace.log`. The first
contains a set of calculated values such as the project version, tag, timestamp, and more. The second contains the
full execution log plus any stacktraces in case of errors. You'll find these files inside `build/jreleaser`.

== Next Steps

* Browse xref:reference:index.adoc[] options.
* Discover all capabilities exposed by the xref:tools:jreleaser-gradle.adoc[].
* Alternatively, configure the xref:reference:assemble/java-archive.adoc[] assembler to create the archive.
* Review the xref:ROOT:checklist.adoc[] before releasing.
